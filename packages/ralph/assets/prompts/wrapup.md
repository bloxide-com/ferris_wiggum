# Context Warning - Wrap Up Current Work

⚠️ **TOKEN THRESHOLD REACHED**

You have reached 70,000 tokens (warning threshold). Please wrap up your current work:

1. **Complete the current logical unit** - Finish the function/component/test you're working on
2. **Run quality checks** - Ensure typecheck, lint, and tests pass
3. **Commit your changes** - Use format: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
4. **Update progress** - Append to `.ralph/progress.md`
5. **Update PRD if story complete** - Set `passes: true` for completed story

Do NOT start new work. The next iteration will continue with fresh context.

## What Happens Next

After you commit and update progress, this iteration will end and a new one will begin with:
- Fresh context window (0 tokens)
- All your committed changes in git
- Updated PRD showing completed stories
- Progress log with your learnings
- Guardrails from any issues encountered

Focus on leaving the codebase in a clean, committable state.
