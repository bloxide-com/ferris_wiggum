  "description": "In the web app’s “New Session” flow, selecting a folder and clicking **Select** can trigger a server error (`Project path does not exist`) even when the folder is valid. Separately, the UI has severe contrast issues (e.g. chat/PRD text appearing white-on-white), and the overall styling needs a cohesive dark-theme polish.",
